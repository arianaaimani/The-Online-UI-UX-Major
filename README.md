# The-Online-UI-UX-Major

Hi Everyone! Welcome to the Online UX/UI Major! I have compiled a list of sources and organized them by relevant topic. I will also be giving a guide on when to take featured courses and what texts to look at! 

Before you begin this journey of entering the field of UX/UI, you should read [this article] (http://www.helloerik.com/ux-is-not-ui). UX != UI but they do go hand in hand. 
## Crash Courses: UX
[UX Crash Course 31 Fundamentals] (http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals)

The author made their New Years Resolution public by publishing 31 lessons on UX in the month of January. The month long crash course has topics ranging from what UX is all the way to A/B testing.
