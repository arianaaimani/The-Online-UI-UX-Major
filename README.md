# The-Online-UI-UX-Major

Hi Everyone! Welcome to the Online UX/UI Major! I have compiled a list of sources and organized them by relevant topic. I will also be giving a guide on when to take featured courses and what texts to look at! 

Before you begin this journey of entering the field of UX/UI, you should read [this article] (http://www.helloerik.com/ux-is-not-ui). UX != UI but they do go hand in hand.
